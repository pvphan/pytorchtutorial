# PyTorch Tutorial

This template provides a quick way to experiment with neural network architectures on the classic [MNIST database of handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) using PyTorch. Library dependencies and dataset parsing are handled for you.

Prerequisites on your local machine are `docker` and `make`.


### Quick start:

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into it.
2. Modify (only) the class `MnistModel` in `mnist.py`. You can use `pytorch.py` as an example.
3. In console, run `make runmnist` to train and test the network
4. Check your results at the end, it will print `Correctly predicted __%` to tell you how the network performed!
